# Using Animal Control Incident Data to Improve Animal Welfare by Community
## DSC 680 - Applied Data Science - Project 1

Can analyzing the incident data collected by animal control agencies provide vital information that can be used to address animal welfare problems specific to individual communities?  Common problems that can benefit from a closer look at animal control statistics include pet overpopulation, cruelty and dogfighting, feral cat community control, and community access to veterinary resources.
